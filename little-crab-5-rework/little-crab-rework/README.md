# little-crab-reworked
The following scenario is a rework of Michael KÃ¶lling's "Little Crab (version 5)" from his textbook "Introduction to Programming with Greenfoot (Second Edition)". The rework adds a number of new game features and recontextualizes the project.

Some new game featues include:

- Ocean setting!

      ~ Changed sand background texture for water background.
  
- New sprites!
  
      ~ Worms and lobsters have been resprited as fish and sharks respectively.
  
      ~ Crabs have been resprited.
  
- Added level and difficulty features!
  
      ~ The game is now infintely playable until the user loses.
  
      ~ For each passing level up to level 6, more sharks at a faster speed are added.
  
        ~ Starting Easier: The game now starts with just 1 slow lobster (speed 3)
  
        ~ Level 2: Adds a second lobster, still at slow speed (2 lobsters at speed 3)
  
        ~ Level 3: Same number of lobsters but faster (2 lobsters at speed 4)
  
        ~ Level 4: Adds a third lobster (3 lobsters at speed 4)
  
        ~ Level 5: Adds a fourth lobster (4 lobsters at speed 4)
  
        ~ Level 6: Same number but faster (4 lobsters at speed 5)
  
  
- Added counters for level, score, attempts and high score.
  
      ~ Presented at the top of the window.
  
      ~ Score is now calculated by adding 10 points for every round and 1 point for each fish eaten
  

Have fun crabs!
